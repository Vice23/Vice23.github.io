		My first GitHub repository
	</h1>
	<p>
		Hello! This is the very first GitHub repository created in 2017. 
		<br>I'm keeping this around as a record of that first test (and a start of a lot of fun learning experiences!), but I invite you to look at some of my more recent learning projects from the Odin Project and MDN.
